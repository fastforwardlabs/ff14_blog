            "content": "Welcome to the first edition of the Cloudera Fast Forward blog on Natural Language Processing for Question Answering! Throughout this series, we’ll build a Question Answering (QA) system with off-the-shelf parts and blog about our process and what we find along the way. We hope to wind up with a beginning-to-end documentary that provides: . insight into QA as a tool, | useful context to make decisions for those who might build their own QA system, | tips and tricks we pick up as we go, | sample code, if we’re lucky (we’ll show our work in notebooks), and | entertainment, as you watch us fumble our way through the process. (Feedback and commentary welcome.) | . We’re trying a new thing here. In the past, Cloudera Fast Forward has documented its work in discrete reports. We hope this new format suits the above goals and makes the topic more accessible, while ultimately being useful. . To kick off the series, this introductory post will discuss what QA is and isn’t, where this technology is being employed, and what techniques are used to accomplish this natural language task. . Question Answering in a Nutshell . Question Answering is a human-machine interaction to extract information from data using natural language queries. Machines do not inherently understand human languages any more than the average human understands machine language. A well-developed QA system bridges the gap between the two, allowing humans to extract knowledge from data in a way that is natural to us, i.e., asking questions. . QA systems accept questions in the form of natural language (typically text based, although you are probably also familiar with systems that accept speech input, such as Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri), and output a concise answer. Google’s search engine product adds a form of question answering in addition to its traditional search results, as illustrated here: . . Google took our question and returned a set of 1.3 million documents (not shown) relevant to the search terms, i.e., documents about Abraham Lincoln. Google also used what it knows about the contents of some of those documents to provide a “snippet” that answered our question in one word, presented above a link to the most pertinent website and keyword-highlighted text. . This goes beyond the standard capabilities of a search engine, which typically only return a list of relevant documents or websites. Google is pretty tight-lipped about its algorithms, so we can’t tell you whether they are harnessing elements of natural language understanding or which algorithms they’re using. We’ll revisit this example in a later section and discuss how we can (and will!) build our own system to demonstrate how question answering works in practice. . Why Question Answering? . Sophisticated Google searches with precise answers are fun, but how useful are QA systems in general? It turns out that this technology is maturing rapidly. Gartner recently identified natural language processing and conversational analytics as one of the top trends poised to make a substantial impact in the next three to five years. These technologies will provide increased data access, ease of use, and wider adoption of analytics platforms - especially to mainstream users. QA systems specifically will be a core part of the NLP suite, and are already seeing adoption in several areas. . . Missing some paragraphs from the Google Doc Designing a Question Answerer . As explained above, question answering systems process natural language queries and output concise answers. This general capability can be implemented in dozens of ways. How a QA system is designed depends, in large part, on three key elements: the knowledge provided to the system, the types of questions it can answer, and the structure of the data supporting the system. . Domain . QA systems operate within a domain, constrained by the data that is provided to them. The domain represents the embodiment of all the knowledge the system can know. There are two domain paradigms: open and closed. Closed domain systems are narrow in scope and focus on a specific topic or regime. Open domain systems are broad, answering general knowledge questions. . Question Type . Once you’ve decided the scope of knowledge your QA system will cover, you must also determine what types of questions it can answer. The vast majority of all QA systems answer factual questions: those that start with who, what, where, when, and how many. These types of questions tend to be straightforward enough for a machine to comprehend, and can be built directly atop structural databases or ontologies, as well as being extracted directly from unstructured text. . However, research is emerging that would allow QA systems to answer hypothetical questions, cause-effect questions, confirmation (yes/no) questions, and inferential questions (questions whose answers can be inferred from one or more pieces of evidence). Much of this research is still in its infancy, however, as the requisite natural language understanding is (for now) beyond the capabilities of most of today’s algorithms. . Implementation . There’s more than one way to cuddle a cat, as the saying goes. Question answering seeks to extract information from data and, generally speaking, data come in two broad formats: structured and unstructured. QA algorithms have been developed to harness the information from either paradigm: knowledge- based systems for structured data and information retrieval-based systems for unstructured (text) data. Some QA systems exploit a hybrid design that harvests information from both data types; IBM’s Watson is a famous example. In this section, we’ll highlight some of the most widely used techniques in each data regime - concentrating more on those for unstructured data, since this will be the focus of our applied research. Because we’ll be discussing explicit methods and techniques, the following sections are more technical. And we’ll note that, while we provide an overview here, an even more comprehensive discussion can be found in the Question Answering chapter of Jurafsky and Martin’s Speech and Language Processing textbook. . Information Retrieval-Based Systems: Retrievers and Readers . . Information retrieval-based question answering (IR QA) systems find and extract a text segment from a large collection of documents. The collection can be as vast as the entire web (open domain) or as specific as a company’s Confluence documents (closed domain). Contemporary IR QA systems first identify the most relevant documents in the collection, and then extract the answer from the contents of those documents. To illustrate this approach, let’s revisit our Google example from the introduction, only this time we’ll include some of the search results! . . We already talked about how the snippet box acts like a QA system. The search results below the snippet illustrate some of the reasons why an IR QA system can be more useful than a search engine alone. The relevant links vary from essentially advertising (study.com), to making fun of Lincoln’s ears (Reddit at its finest), to a discussion of color blindness (answers.com without the answer we want), to an article about all presidents’ eye color (getting warmer, Chicago Tribune), to the last link, answers.yahoo.com, which is on-topic, and narrowly scoped to Lincoln but gives an ambiguous answer. Without the snippet box at the top, a user would have to skim each of these links looking for their answer. . IR QA systems are not just search engines, which take general natural language terms and provide a list of relevant documents. IR QA systems perform an additional layer of processing on the most relevant documents to deliver a pointed answer based on the contents of those documents (like the snippet box). While we won’t hazard a guess at exactly how Google extracted “gray” from these search results, we can examine how an IR QA system could exhibit similar functionality in a real world (e.g., non-Google) implementation. Below we illustrate the workflow of a generic IR-based QA system. These systems generally have two main components: the document retriever and the document reader. . . The document retriever functions as the search engine, ranking and retrieving relevant documents to which it has access. It supplies a set of candidate documents that could answer the question (often with mixed results, per the Google search shown above). The second component is the document reader: reading comprehension algorithms built with core NLP techniques. This component processes the candidate documents and extracts from one of them an explicit span of text that best satisfies the query. Let’s dive into each of these components. .",
