At Cloudera Fast Forward, we routinely report on the latest and greatest in machine learning capabilities. Typically, our applied research culminates in a series of comprehensive reports released on a quarterly basis, along with a live webinar demonstrating the prototypes we build in conjunction with that research. But times they are a-changin’ and we’re experimenting with new formats for distributing our content! This time, instead of waiting until the prototype is finished and the report is polished, we thought it would be fun to invite you to join us _while we build_. Our posts will focus on the technical and practical aspects of building a QA system, including code samples. Because research of any kind is an inherently messy endeavor, be prepared for some ups and downs and maybe even a post or two about some tricky bugs we run across!
