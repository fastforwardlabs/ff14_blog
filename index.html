Welcome to Cloudera Fast Forward Labs' Question Answering blog. We at CFFL routinely report on the latest and greatest in 
machine learning capabilities. Typically our applications research culminates in a sereies of comprehensive reports that 
we distribute to our customers on a quarterly basis. But times are a-changin' and we're experimenting with new formats for 
distributing our content. For this project we thought it would be fun to invite you to join us _while_ we build instead of 
waiting till the end. Our posts will focus on the technical and practical aspects of building a QA system, 
including code samples. Because research of any kind is an inherently messy endeavor, be prepared for
some ups and downs and maybe even a post or two about some tricky bugs we run across!
