Welcome to Cloudera Fast Forward Labs' Question Answering blog. We at CFFL routinely report on the latest and greatest in 
machine learning capabilities. Typically our applications research culminates in a sereies of comprehensive reports that 
we distribute to our customers on a quarterly basis. But times are a-changin'.  Not only have we lifted our paywall, we're 
also experimenting with new formats for distributing our content. For this project we thought it would be fun to invite 
you to join us while we build instead of waiting till the end. Our posts will focus on the technical and practical aspects 
building a QA system, including code samples. Because research of any kind is an inherently a messy endeavor, be prepared for
some ups and downs and maybe even a post or two about some tricky bugs we run across!
