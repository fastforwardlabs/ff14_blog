[Cloudera Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/about/services-and-support/fast-forward-labs.html) is a machine intelligence research company reporting on the recently possible. We routinely publish comprehensive reports that focus on a wide variety of machine learning capabilities. This blog focuses on the latest of these endeavors: question answering, a natural language processing and understanding (NLP/U) task that has recently begun to show signs of maturity. FF14 documents our approach to implenting this model in a general setting but with corporate use cases in mind. 

This project is led by two of CFFL's Research Engineers: 

## Melanie R. Beck, Ph.D.
[Melanie](www.linkedin.com/in/melanierbeck) is a reformed astrophysicist who now spends her days dreaming about machines and algorithms (to be honest, she still dreams about galaxies too). She excels at understanding academic inventions but is even better at translating them into a language the rest of us can understand. Lately she’s been obsessed with all things NLP. With experience as a data scientist in multiple industries from hardware manufacturing to cybersecurity, she is a jack of all trades with a passion for sharing what she’s learned. When she’s not reading about some esoteric machine learning framework she can found playing with her dog and two cats, or doing some cross stitching. 

## Ryan Micallef
[Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micallef/) researches emerging machine learning technologies and helps clients apply them. He is also an attorney barred in New York. He was an intellectual property litigator focused on technical cases for almost a decade before joining Fast Forward Labs. Ryan has a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and a Juris Doctor degree from Brooklyn Law School. Ryan spends his free time soldering circuits and wrenching motorcycles. He teaches microcontroller programming at his local hackerspace, NYC Resistor.
