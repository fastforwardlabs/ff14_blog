[Cloudera Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/about/services-and-support/fast-forward-labs.html) is a machine intelligence research and advisory group within Cloudera. We routinely publish comprehensive reports that focus on a wide variety of machine learning capabilities. This blog focuses on question answering, a natural language processing and understanding (NLP/U) task that has recently begun to show signs of maturity, and documents our approach to implementing this model in a general setting, but with corporate use cases in mind.
This project is led by two of CFF’s Research Engineers.
