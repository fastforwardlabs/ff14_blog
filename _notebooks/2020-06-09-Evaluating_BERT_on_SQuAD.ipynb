    "In our last post, [Building a QA System with BERT on Wikipedia](https://qa.fastforwardlabs.com/pytorch/hugging%20face/wikipedia/bert/transformers/2020/05/19/Getting_Started_with_QA.html), we used the HuggingFace framework to train BERT on the SQuAD2.0 dataset and built a simple QA system on top of the Wikipedia search engine. This time, we'll look at how to assess the quality of a BERT-like model for Question Answering. We'll cover what metrics are used to quantify quality, how to evaluate your model using the Hugging Face framework, and the importance of the \"null response\" -- questions that don't have answers -- for both improved performance and more realistic QA output.  By the end of this post we'll implement a more robust answering method for our QA system. \n",

Additionally, much of the code in this post is inspired by the HF `squad_metrics.py` [script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/5856999a9f2926923f037ecd8d27b8058bcf9dae/src/transformers/data/metrics/squad_metrics.py).

    "# Answering questions is complicated\n",
    "Quantifying the success of answering a question is a tricky task. When you or I ask a question, the correct answer could take multiple forms. For example, in our previous post, BERT answered the question, \"Why is the sky blue?\" with \"Rayleigh scattering\" but another answer would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "> The Earth's atmosphere scatters short-wavelength light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths. Because its wavelengths are shorter, blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green. Hence the result that when looking at the sky away from the direct incident sunlight, the human eye perceives the sky to be blue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these passages can be found in the Wikipedia article [Diffuse Sky Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation) and both are correct. However, I've also had a model answer with \"because its wavelengths are shorter\", which is close but not really a correct answer - the sky itself doesn't have a wavelength. This answer is missing too much context to be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we'd asked a question that couldn't be answered by the Diffuse Sky Radiation page? For example: \"Could the sky ever be green?\" If you read that Wiki article you'll see there probably isn't a sure-fire answer to this question. What should the model do in this case? \n",
    "\n",
    "How should we judge a model when there are multiple correct answers, even more incorrect answers, and potentially no answer? To properly assess quality we need a labeled set of questions and answers. Let's turn back to the SQuAD dataset."

    "# Metrics for QA\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two dominant metrics used by many question answering datasets, including SQuAD: exact match (EM) and F1 score. These scores are computed on individual question+answer pairs. When multiple correct answers are possible for a given question, the maximum score over all possible correct answers is computed. Overall EM and F1 scores are computed for a model by averaging over the individual example scores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exact Match\n",
    "This metric is as simple as it sounds. For each question+answer pair, if the _characters_ of the model's prediction exactly match the characters of (one of) the true answer(s), EM = 1, otherwise EM = 0. This is a strict all-or-nothing metric; being off by a single character results in a score of 0. When assessing against a negative example, if the model predicts any text at all it automatically receives a 0 for that example. \n",
    "\n",
    "### F1 \n",
    "F1 score is a common metric for classification problems, and widely used in QA. It is appropriate when we care equally about precision and recall. In this case, it's computed over the individual _words_ in the prediction against those in the true answer.  The number of shared words between the prediction and the truth is the basis of the F1 score: precision is the ratio of the number of shared words to the total number of words in the _prediction_, and recall is the ratio of the number of shared words to the total number of words in the _ground truth_. \n",

In fact, the original BERT paper suggested considering any sensible start+end combination as a possible answer to the question.

The probability of an answer span is the probability of a given start token S and an end token E: P(S and E) = P(S)P(E) because the start and end tokens are treated as being independent.

For example, an answer wherein the end token falls _before_ the start token should be excluded because that just doesn't make sense. Candidate answers wherein the start or end tokens are associated with question tokens are also excluded because the answer to the question should obviously not be in the question itself! It is important to note that the [CLS] token and its corresonding logits are **not** removed because this token indicates the null answer. "

The downside is that we lose some ground in how well our model correctly predicts `HasAns` examples. Overall, however, we see a net increase of a couple points in both EM and F1 scores.

    "Using a robust prediction method like the above will do more than allow your model to perform better on a curated dev set, though this is an important first step. It will also provide your model with a slightly better ability to refrain from answering questions that simply don't have an answer in the associated passage. This is a crucial feature for QA models because it's not enough to get an answer if that answer doesn't make sense. We want our models to tell us something useful -- and sometimes that means telling us nothing at all.  "
