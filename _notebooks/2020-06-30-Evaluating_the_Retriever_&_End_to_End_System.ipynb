In this post, we'll focus on the former component of an end-to-end QA system - the Retriever. Specifically, we'll introduce Elasticsearch as a powerful and efficient Information Retrieval (IR) tool that can be used to scour through large corpora and retrieve relevant documents. Through the post, we'll explain how to implement and evaluate a Retriever in the context of Question Answering and demonstrate the impact it has on an end-to-end QA system."

    "As we have discussed throughout this blog series, many modern QA systems take a two-staged approach to answering questions. In the first stage, a document retriever selects *N* potentially relevant documents from a given corpus. Subsequently, a machine comprehension model processes each of the *N* documents to determine an answer to the input question. Because of recent advances in NLP and deep learning (i.e. flashy Transformer models), the machine comprehension component of question answering has typically been the main focus of evaluation. Stage one of these systems has recieved limited attention despite its obvious importance...stage two is bounded by performance at stage one. Let's get more specific.\n",

While the ability to properly comprehend a passage and produce a correct answer is a critical feature of any QA tool, the success of the overall system is highly dependent on first providing a correct passage to read through. Without being fed a context passage that actually contains the ground-truth answer, the overall system's performance is limited to how well it can predict no-answer questions. To demonstrate, we'll revisit an example from our [second blog post](https://qa.fastforwardlabs.com/pytorch/hugging%20face/wikipedia/bert/transformers/2020/05/19/Getting_Started_with_QA.html) where three questions were asked of the Wikipedia search engine based QA system:"

    "In Example 1, the Reader had no chance of producing the correct answer because of its outright absence from the context served up by the Retriever. Namely, the Retriever erroneously provided a page about Barack Obama Sr. instead of his son, the former US President. In this case, the only way the Reader could have possibly produced the correct answer was if the correct answer was actually not to answer at all. On the flip side, in Example 3, the Retriever did not identify the globally \"correct\" document - it returned an article about \"The Pentagon\" instead of a page about geometry - but nonetheless, it provided enough context for the Reader to succeed.\n",

    "Modern QA systems employ a variety of techniques for the task of information retrieval ranging from traditional sparse vector word matching (ex. Elasticsearch) to [novel approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf) using dense representations of encoded passages combined with [efficient search capabilities](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss). Despite the flurry of contemporary research efforts in this area, the traditional sparse vector approach performs very well overall and has only recently been overtaken by embedding-based systems for end-to-end QA retrieval tasks. For that reason, we'll explore Elasticsearch as an easy to use framework for document retrieval. So, what exactly is Elasticsearch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine built on the [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) library that is capable of handling all types of data including textual, numerical, geospatial, structrured, and unstructured. It is built to scale with a robust set of features, rich ecosystem, and diverse list of client libraries making it easy to integrate and use. In the context of information retrieval for automated question answering, we are keenly interested in the features surrounding full-text search. Elasticsearch provides a convenient way to index documents so they can quickly be queried for nearest neighbor search using a TF-IDF based similarity metric. Specifically, it uses [BM25](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2015/10/16/bm25-the-next-generation-of-lucene-relevation/) term weighting to represent question and context passages as high-dimensional, sparse vectors that are efficiently searched in an inverted index. For more information on how an inverted index works under the hood, we recommend this quick and concise [blog post](https://codingexplained.com/coding/elasticsearch/understanding-the-inverted-index-in-elasticsearch)."

    "Before we go further, let's introduce a few concepts that are specific to Elasticsearch and the process of indexing data. In Elasticsearch, an ***index*** is a collection of documents that have common characteristics (similar to a database schema in an RDBMS). ***Documents*** are JSON objects having their own set of key-value pairs consisting of various data types (similar to rows/fields in RDBMS). When we add a document into an index, the value for the document's text fields go through an analysis process prior to being indexed. This means that when executing a search query against an existing index, we are actually searching against the post-processed representation that is stored in the inverted index, not the raw input document itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "The anaysis process is a customizable pipeline carried out by a dedicated ***Analyzer***. Elasticsearch analyzers are composed of three sequential steps that form a processing pipeline: *character filters, a tokenizer, and token filters.* Each of these components modify the input stream of text according to some configurable settings. \n",
    "- **Character Filters:** First, character filters have the ability to add, remove, or replace specific items in the text field. A common application of this filter is to strip `html` markup from the raw input. \n",
    "- **Tokenizer:** After applying character filters, the transformed text is then passed to a tokenizer which breaks up the input string into individual tokens with a provided strategy. By default, the `standard` tokenizer splits tokens whenever it encounters a whitespace character, and also splits on most symbols (like commas, periods, semicolons, etc.)\n",
    "- **Token Filters:** Finally, the token stream is passed to a token filter which acts to add, remove, or modify tokens. Typical token filters include `lowercase` which converts all tokens to lowercase form, and `stop` which removes commonly occuring tokens called *stopwords*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch comes with several built-in Analyzers that satisfy common use cases and defaults to the `Standard Analyzer`. The Standard Analyzer doesn't contain any character filters, uses a `standard` tokenizer, and applies a `lowercase` token filter.

    "Ok, so we now have a basic understanding of how to use Elasticsearch as an IR tool to return some results for a given question, but how do we know if it's working? How do we evaluate what a good IR tool looks like?\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate how well our Retriever is working, we'll need two things: some labeled examples (i.e. SQuAD2.0 question/answer pairs) and some performance metrics. In the conventional world of information retrieval, there are [many metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_measures_(information_retrieval)) used to quantify the relevance of query results - largely centered around the concepts of precision and recall. For IR in the context of question answering, we adapt some of these ideas into two commonly used evaluation metrics: *recall* and *mean average precision (mAP)*. Additionally, we evaluate the amount of time required to execute a query since the main point of having a two stage QA system is to efficiently narrow the large search space for our Reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, recall in IR indicates the fraction of all relevant documents that are retrieved. In the context of end-to-end QA systems sitting on large corpora of documents, we are less concerned with finding *all* of the passages containing the answer (because it would take significant time to read through all of them anyway) and more concerned with the binary presence of a passage containing the correct answer being returned. In that light, we define a Retriever's recall across a set of questions as *the percentage of questions for which the answer segment appears in one of the top N pages returned by the search method.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Average Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *recall* metric focuses on the minimum viable result set to enable a Reader for success, we do still care about the composition of that result set. We want a metric that rewards a Retriever for a.) returning a lot of answer-containing documents in the result set (i.e. traditional meaning of precision) and b.) returning those answer-containing documents higher up in the result set than non-answer-containing documents (i.e. ranking them correctly). This is precisely (🙃) what mean average precision (mAP) does for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain mAP further, let's first break down the concept of average precision for information retrieval. If our Retriever is asked to return N documents and the total number of those N documents that actually contains the answer is m, then average precision (AP) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/ff14_blog/blob/master/_notebooks/my_icons/map_equation.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "where *rel(k)* is just a binary indication of whether the *kth* passage contains the correct answer segment or not. Using a concrete example, consider retrieving *N=3* documents, of which one actually contains the correct answer segment. Here are three scenarios for how this could happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/ff14_blog/blob/master/_notebooks/my_icons/map_example.png?raw=1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Despite the fact that in each scenario we only have one document containing the correct answer, Scenario A is rewarded with the highest score because it was able to correctly rank the ground truth document relative to the others returned. Since average precision is calculated on a per query basis, the mean average precision is simply just *the average AP across all queries*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now using our Wikipedia passage index, let's define a function called `evaluate_retriever` to loop through all quesion/answer examples from the SQuAD2.0 train set and see how well our Elasticsearch retriever peforms in terms of recall, mAP, and averege query duration when retrieving *N=3* passages."

    "Identifying a correct passage in the Top 3 results for 82% of the SQuAD questions in ~3 milliseconds per question is not too bad! But that means that we've effectively limited our overall QA system to an 82% upper bound on performance. How can we improve upon this?\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple and obvious way to increase recall would be to just retrieve more passages. The following figure shows the effects of varying corpus size and result size on Elasticsearch retriever recall. As expected we see that the number of passages retrieved (i.e. *Top N*) has a dramatic impact on recall; a ~10-15 point jump from 1 to 3 passages returned, and ~5 point jump for each of the other tiers. We also see a gradual decrease in recall as corpus size increases, which isn't surprising.\n",

    "![Recall vs. Corpus Size](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/ff14_blog/blob/master/_notebooks/my_icons/recall_v_corpussize.png?raw=1 \"Experimental results demonstrating the impact of increasing corpus size and number of results retrieved on Elasticsearch recall.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "While increasing the number of passages retrieved is effective, it also has implications on overall system performance as the already slow Reader now has to reason over more text. Instead, we can lean on best practices in the well explored domain of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing full-text search is a battle between precision (returning as few irrelevant documents as possible) and recall (returning as many relevant documents as possible). Matching only exact words in the question query results in high precision, however it misses out on many passages that could possibly be considered relevant. Rather we can cast a wider net by searching for terms that are not exactly the same as in the question query, but are related in some way. Let's explore a few tips and tricks for widening the net.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in the post we described Elasticsearch Analyzers as a way to deal with the nuances of human language. Analyzers provide a flexible and extensible method to tailor search for a given dataset. Here are a few custom Analyzer components Elasticsearch provides that can help cast a wider net.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stopwords**: Stopwords are the most frequently occuring words in the English language (ex. \"and\", \"the\", \"to\", etc.) and add minimal semantic value to a piece of text. Common practice in information retrieval is to identify and remove them from documents to decrease the size of the index and increase relevance of search results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemming**: The English language is inflected - words can alter their written form to express different meanings. For example, 'sing', 'sings', 'sang', and 'singing' are written with slight differences, but really mean the same thing. Stemming is a technique that attempts to reduce words to their root form and consequently improve retrievability. Stemming algorithms exploit the fact that search intent is *usually* word-form agnostic - which is not always the case. For example, the phrases \"fly fishing\" and \"flying fish\" both stem to \"fli fish\" which would provide a very incorrect result depending on the users intent. Despite that, stemming does increase search recall by relaxing query term inflection. We'll implement the [Snowball](https://snowballstem.org/) stemming algorithm as a token filter in our custom Analyzer."

    "There are multiple strategies for passing documents from the retriever to the reader. \n",
    "1. Pass each document to the reader individually then aggregate the resulting scores\n",
    "2. Concatenate all documents and pass to the reader simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has pros and cons and ultimately, we found that it was better to go with option 2. The reason lies in the aggregation step inherent to option 1. The reader returns answers and scores for each document. A series of heuristics must be developed to determine which answer is the best, and when the null answer should be returned -- made all the more challenging when 4 of your 5 documents return strong null answer scores (0.99) and one document returns a non-null answer with a weak score (0.34)!  Furthermore, due to the nature of how these scores are computed, it is difficult to compare them on the same scale -- an answer with a score of 0.78 from one document might not actually be inherently \"better\" than an answer with a score of .70 from another document! Digging into why this is so is beyond the scope of this article but we'd be happy to discuss it further with those who are interested! Finally, this option is slower because each article is passed individually leading to multiple BERT calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we opted for option 2. Creating one long context out of the top n articles solves many problems for us: \n",
    "1. all candidate answers are scored on the same scale,\n",
    "2. handling the null answer is more straightforward (we did that last time),\n",
    "3. and we can take advantage of faster compute as HF will chunk long documents for us and pass them through BERT in a batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when concatenating multiple passages together, there's a good chance that BERT will see a mixed context: the end of one paragraph grafted onto the beginning of another, for example. This could make it more difficult for the model to correctly identify an answer in a potentially confusing context. Another drawback is that it's more difficult to backstrapolate which of the input documents the answer ultimately came from. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a reader class that leverages the HF question-answering `pipeline` to do the brunt of the work for us (loading models and tokenizers, converting text to features, chunking, prediction, etc.). We then created two methods: `predict` and `predict_combine` corresponding to the two options above. In what follows we'll use `predict_combine` to concatenate the documents the retriever sends to the reader for a given question. \n",
