In this post, we'll focus on the former component of an end-to-end QA system - the Retriever. Specifically, we'll introduce Elasticsearch as a powerful and efficient Information Retrieval (IR) tool that can be used to scour through large corpora and retrieve relevant documents. Through the post, we'll explain how to implement and evaluate a Retriever in the context of Question Answering and demonstrate the impact it has on an end-to-end QA system."

    "As we have discussed throughout this blog series, many modern QA systems take a two-staged approach to answering questions. In the first stage, a document retriever selects $N$ potentially relevant documents from a given corpus. Subsequently, a machine comprehension model processes each of the $N$ documents to determine an answer to the input question. Because of recent advances in NLP and deep learning (i.e. flashy Transformer models), the machine comprehension component of question answering has typically been the main focus of evaluation. Stage one of these systems has recieved limited attention despite its obvious importance...stage two is bounded by performance at stage one. Let's get more specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "We [recently explained methods]() that enable BERT-like models to produce robust answers given a question and context passage by selectively processing predictions and by refraining from answering certain questions at all. While the ability to properly comprehend a passage and produce a correct answer is a critical feature of any QA tool, the success of the overall system is highly dependent on first providing a correct passage to read through. Without being fed a context passage that actually contains the ground-truth answer, the overall system's performance is limited to how well it can predict no-answer questions. To demonstrate, we'll revisit an example from our [first blog post]() where three questions were asked of the Wikipedia search engine based QA system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 1: Incorrect**\n",
    "Question: When was Barack Obama born?\n",
    "Top wiki result: <WikipediaPage 'Barack Obama Sr.'>\n",
    "Answer: 18 June 1936 / February 2 , 1961 / \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Correct**\n",
    "Question: Why is the sky blue?\n",
    "Top wiki result: <WikipediaPage 'Diffuse sky radiation'>\n",
    "Answer: Rayleigh scattering / \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Correct**\n",
    "Question: How many sides does a pentagon have?\n",
    "Top wiki result: <WikipediaPage 'The Pentagon'>\n",
    "Answer: five / \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 1, the Reader had no chance of producing the correct answer because of its outright absence from the context served up by the Retriever. Namely, the Retriever erroneously provided a page about Barack Obama Sr. instead of his son, the former US President. In this case, the only way the Reader could have possibly produced the correct answer was if the correct answer was actually not to answer at all. On the flip side, in Example 3, the Retriever did not identify the globally \"correct\" document - it returned an article about \"The Pentagon\" instead of a page about geometry - but nonetheless, it provided enough context for the Reader to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These quick examples illustrate why an effective Retriever is crucial for an end-to-end QA system. Now let's take a deeper look at a classic tool used for information retrieval - Elasticsearch."

    "Modern QA systems employ a variety of techniques for the task of information retrieval ranging from traditional sparse vector word matching (ex. Elasticsearch) to [novel approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf) using dense representations of encoded passages combined with [efficient search capabilities](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss). Despite the flurry of contemporary research efforts in this area, the traditional sparse vector approach performs very well overall and has only recently been overtaken by embedding-based systems for end-to-end QA retrieval tasks. For that reason, we'll explore Elasticsearch as an easy to use framework for document retrieval. So, what exactly is Elasticsearch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine built on the [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) library that is capable of handling all types of data including textual, numerical, geospatial, structrured, and unstructured. It is built to scale with a robust set of features, rich ecosystem, and diverse list of client libraries making it easy to integrate and use. In the context of information retrieval for automated question answering, we are keenly interested in the features surrounding full-text search. Elasticsearch provides a convenient way to index documents so they can quickly be queried for nearest neighbor search using a TF-IDF based similarity metric. Specifically, it uses [BM25](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2015/10/16/bm25-the-next-generation-of-lucene-relevation/) term weighting to represent question and context passages as high-dimensional, sparse vectors that are efficiently searched in an inverted index. Let's unpack those ideas a bit.\n"

    "The purpose of an inverted index is to store text in a data structure that allows for efficient and fast full-text searches. An inverted index is essentially just a mapping between unique terms and documents which contain those terms. For example, consider the following two documents and a depiction of an inverted index built from them:\n",
    "1. \"Elasticsearch is a powerful technique for search!\"\n",
    "2. \"Manual search is a slow technique.\"\n",

    "|      for      |      x     |            |\n",

    "Notice that the unique set of terms from both documents are contained in the index, and we can easily lookup which document contains which terms. Searching this inverted index for the phrase \"search technique\" would return both documents because both terms are present in each document, while searching for the phrase \"powerful technique\" would return only Document 1. Search itself is quite a bit more complicated than the boolean logic depicted here as it involves relevance scoring (among other query dependent logic), however this oversimplification is intended to demonstrate the quick and powerful nature of the inverted index data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In the example above, all tokens have been lowercased and punctuation removed. This happens as part of an important preprocessing pipeline that we'll explain in more detail later in the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverted index representation is considered *sparse* by construction because for each document, you end up with a vector containing few terms relative to all terms in the index. This indexing process is what allows Elasticsearch to peruse large collections of text documents orders of magnitude faster than traditional SQL databases. While the exact match nature of search in this data structure is powerful and effective, it isn't without flaws. Word matching is limited in its ability to take semantically related concepts into search consideration. For example, consider the following question and context borrowed from the [DPR paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Question:** \"Who is the bad guy in lord of the rings?\"\\\n",
    "> **Context:** \"Sala Baker is an actor and stuntman from New Zealand. He is best known for portraying the villain Sauron in the Lord of the Rings trilogy...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An exact match based system like Elasticsearch would struggle to retrieve this supporting context passage because it lacks the ability to relate the concepts of \"bad guy\" and \"villain\". Modern document retrieval systems that take advantage of learned, dense representations of text would perform better in this situation."

    "1. **Transformer based Readers are very slow** - providing an entire Wikipedia article to BERT for processing takes a considerable amount of time and also defeats the purpose of using an IR tool to narrow the search space for the Reader.\n",

By reducing passage size, we are potentially trading off system recall for speed - though there are techniques to alleviate this as we will disucss later in the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our chunking approach, each article paragraph will be prepended with the article title and collectively serve as a corpus of documents for which our Elasticsearch Retriever will search over. In practice, open-domain QA systems sit atop massive collections of documents (think all of Wikipedia) to provide a breadth of information to answer general-knowledge questions from. For the purposes of demonstrating Elasticsearch functionality, we will limit our corpus to only the Wikipedia articles supporting SQuAD2.0 questions."

    "Before we go further, let's introduce a few concepts that are specific to Elasticsearch and the process of indexing data. In Elasticsearch, an ***index*** is a collection of documents that have common characteristics (similar to a database schema in an RDBMS). ***Documents*** are JSON objects having their own set of key-value pairs consisting of various data types (similar to rows/fields in RDBMS). When we add a document into an index, the value for the document's text fields go through an analysis process prior to being indexed. This means that when executing a search query against an existing index, we are actually searching against the post-processed representation that is stored in the inverted index, not the raw input document itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "The anaysis process is a customizable pipeline carried out by a dedicated ***Analyzer***. Elasticsearch analyzers are composed of three sequential steps that form a processing pipeline: *character filters, a tokenizer, and token filters.* Each of these components modify the input stream of text according to some configurable settings. \n",
    "- **Character Filters:** First, character filters have the ability to add, remove, or replace specific items in the text field. A common application of this filter is to strip `html` markup from the raw input. \n",
    "- **Tokenizer:** After applying character filters, the transformed text is then passed to a tokenizer which breaks up the input string into individual tokens with a provided strategy. By default, the `standard` tokenizer splits tokens whenever it encounters a whitespace character, and also splits on most symbols (like commas, periods, semicolons, etc.)\n",
    "- **Token Filters:** Finally, the token stream is passed to a token filter which acts to add, remove, or modify tokens. Typical token filters include `lowercase` which converts all tokens to lowercase form, and `stop` which removes commonly occuring tokens called *stopwords*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch comes with several built-in Analyzers that satisfy common use cases and defaults to the `Standard Analyzer`. The Standard Analyzer doesn't contain any character filters, uses a `standard` tokenizer, and applies a `lowercase` token filter. Let's take a look at [a borrowed example](https://medium.com/elasticsearch/introduction-to-analysis-and-analyzers-in-elasticsearch-4cf24d49ddab) sentence as its passed through this pipeline:\n",

    "Ok, so we now have a basic understanding of how to use Elasticsearch as an IR tool to return some results for a given question, but how do we know if it's working? How do we evaluate what a good IR tool looks like? Like we pointed out in the introduction of this post, if the Retriever component of our QA system doesn't provide the correct passage to the Reader, we are doomed from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate how well our Retriever is working, we'll need two things: some labeled examples (i.e. SQuAD2.0 question/answer pairs) and some performance metrics. In the conventional world of information retrieval, there are [many metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_measures_(information_retrieval)) used to quantify the relevance of a set of query results - largely centered around the concepts of precision and recall. For IR in the context of question answering, we adapt some of these ideas into two metrics: *recall* and *mean average precision (mAP)*. Additionally, we evaluate the amount of time required to execute a query since the main point of having a two stage QA system is to efficiently narrow the large search space for our Reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, recall in IR indicates the fraction of all relevant documents that are retrieved. In the context of end-to-end QA systems sitting on large corpora of documents, we are less concerned with finding *all* of the passages containing the answer (because it would take significant time to read through all of them anyway) and more concerned with the binary presence of a passage containing the correct answer being returned. In that light, we define a Retriever's recall across a set of questions as the *percentage of questions for which the answer segment appears in one of the top N pages returned by the search method.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Average Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *recall* metric focuses on the minimum viable result set to enable the Reader for success, we do still care about the composition of that result set. We want a metric that rewards a Retriever for a.) returning a lot of answer-containing documents in the result set (i.e. traditional meaning of precision) and b.) returning those answer-containing documents higher up in the result set than non-answer-containing documents (i.e. ranking them correctly). This is precisely (🙃) what mean average precision (mAP) does for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain mAP further, let's first break down the concept of average precision for information retrieval. If our Retriever is asked to return N documents and the total number of those N documents that actually contains the answer is m, then average precision (AP) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "AP@N = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^N (P(k) \\text{ if the }k^{th} \\text{ item contains the answer)} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^N P(k)*rel(k)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $rel(k)$ is just a binary indication of whether the $k^{th}$ passage contains the correct answer segment or not. Using a concrete example, consider retrieving $N=3$ documents, of which one actually contains the correct answer segment. Here are three scenarios for how this could happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Binary Indication | Precision @k's |     Average Precision @N     |\n",
    "|:--------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:----------------------------:|\n",
    "|     A    |     [1, 0, 0]     |   [1/1, 0, 0]  |   (1/1)*[(1/1) + 0 + 0] = 1  |\n",
    "|     B    |     [0, 1, 0]     |   [0, 1/2, 0]  |  (1/1)*[0 + (1/2) + 0] = 0.5 |\n",
    "|     C    |     [0, 0, 1]     |   [0, 0, 1/3]  | (1/1)*[0 + 0 + (1/3)] = 0.33 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that in each scenario we only have one document containing the correct answer, Scenario A is rewarded with the highest score because it was able to correctly rank the ground truth document relative to the others returned. Since average precision is calculated on a per query basis, the mean average precision is simply just the average AP across all queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now using our Wikipedia passage index, let's define a function called `evaluate_retriever` to loop through all quesion/answer examples from the SQuAD2.0 train set and see how well our Elasticsearch retriever peforms in terms of recall, mAP, and averege query duration when retrieving $N=3$ passages."

    "Identifying a correct passage in the Top 3 results for 82% of the SQuAD questions in ~3.4 milliseconds per question is not too bad! But that means that we've effectively limited our overall QA system to an 82% upper bound on performance. How can we improve upon this?\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple and obvious way to increase recall would be to just retrieve more passages. The following figure shows the effects of varying corpus size and result size on Elasticsearch retriever recall. As expected we see that the number of passages retrieved (i.e. *Top N*) has a dramatic impact on recall; a ~10-15 point jump from 1 to 3 passages returned, and ~5 point jump for each of the other tiers. We also see a gradual decrease in recall as corpus size increases, which isn't surprising.\n",

    "![Elasticsearch Index Process](my_icons/Recall_v_corpussize.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While increasing the number of passages retrieved is effective, it also has implications on overall system performance as the already slow Reader now has to reason over more text. Instead, we can lean on best practices in the well explored domain of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing full-text search is a battle between precision (returning as few irrelevant documents as possible) and recall (returning as many relevant documents as possible). Matching only exact words in the question query results in high precision, however it misses out on many passages that could possibly be considered relevant. Rather we can cast a wider net by searching for terms that are not exactly the same as in the question query, but are related in some way. Let's explore a few tips and tricks for widening the net.\n",

    "Earlier in the post we described Elasticsearch Analyzers as a way to deal with the nuances of human language. Analyzers provide a flexible and extensible method to tailor search for a given dataset. Here are a few custom Analyzer components Elasticsearch provides that can help cast a wider net.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stopwords**: Stopwords are the most frequently occuring words in the English language (ex. \"and\", \"the\", \"to\", etc.) and add minimal semantic value to a piece of text. Common practice in information retrieval is to identify and remove them from documents to decrease the size of the index and increase relevance of search results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemming**: The English language is inflected - words can alter their written form to express different meanings. For example, 'sing', 'sings', 'sang', and 'singing' are written with slight differences, but really mean the same thing. Stemming is a technique that attempts to reduce words to their root form and consequently improve retrievability. Stemming algorithms exploit the fact that search intent is *usually* word-form agnostic - which is not always the case. For example, the phrases \"fly fishing\" and \"flying fish\" both stem to \"fli fish\" which would provide a very incorrect result depending on the users intent. Despite that, stemming does increase search recall by relaxing query term inflection. We'll implement the [Snowball](https://snowballstem.org/) stemming algorithm as a token filter in our custom Analyzer."
